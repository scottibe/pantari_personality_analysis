    <h1>What Do Your Scores Mean?</h1>
  <p>Personality Analysis results are developed based on the psychology of language in combination with data analytics algorithms. The characteristics are described in terms of three models: The Big Five, Needs and Values.</p>
    
   <p>For each analysis, the Pantari Analyzer, via IBM's Watson AI technology, always reports a normalized score as a percentile for each Big Five, Values, and Needs personality characteristic. Normalized scores represent a percentile ranking for each characteristic based on qualities inferred from the input text. The service computes normalized scores by comparing the raw score for the author's text with results from a sample population.</p>
  <p>For example, a score of 65% indicates that the author of the text scored in the 65th percentile for that characteristic. The author's writing exhibits the tendency to an extent that is greater than 64 percent and less than 34 percent of the sample population. The precision of the percentile depends on the number of words that were submitted as input with the request. The text should be 3,000 words or more. However, for best results, use 8,000+ words.  </p>

<h3>Descriptions for each category.</h3>

<h3>The Big Five</h3>
<p><strong>Openness</strong> Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent, and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine.</p> 
<p>High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences, such as skydiving, living abroad, gambling, et cetera. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance, and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven.</p>

<p><strong>conscientiousness</strong> A tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.</p>

<p><strong>extraversion</strong> Energy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed.
</p>
<p><strong>agreeableness</strong> A tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentative or untrustworthy.",
</p>
<p><strong>neuroticism</strong> The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, 'emotional stability.' A high need for stability manifests as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low need for stability causes a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure.
